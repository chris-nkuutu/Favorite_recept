The program essentially prints details about three recipes, including their names and ingredients. 
The \n characters are used to create new lines for better readability in the output. 
The recipes and their details are hardcoded in the program. 
If you wanted to make this more dynamic, you could consider using data structures like arrays or lists to store recipe information and then iterate over them to print the details.
